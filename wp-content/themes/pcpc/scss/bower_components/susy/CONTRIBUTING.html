<h1 id="contributingtosusy">Contributing to Susy</h1>

<p>Susy exists because of people contributing
ideas, code, issues, and sites.
Have you built a <a href="http://susy.oddbird.net/sites-using-susy/">site using Susy</a>?
<a href="https://github.com/ericam/susysite/tree/master/content/sites-using-susy.rst">Add it to the list</a>.</p>

<h2 id="havingissues">Having issues?</h2>

<p>First, try searching for similar questions/answers
that are already online.
If you don&#8217;t see anything,
let us know.
We&#8217;re always happy to help!</p>

<p>If it looks like a bug,
post it in the <a href="https://github.com/ericam/susy/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>.
If you&#8217;re just looking for advice
on creative uses of Susy,
maybe <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/susy-sass">Stack Overflow</a>
is the place for you.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t worry,
we&#8217;ll field questions posted in either locations.
Make sure you explain the context around your problem
with code examples, screenshots,
or other relevant details.
Best if you can provide a simple code sample
that recreates the bug consistently.
The more you tell us,
and the more specific you are,
the better we can help.</p>

<h2 id="haveanidea">Have an idea?</h2>

<p>Susy wouldn&#8217;t exist in it&#8217;s current form,
without the ideas and feature requests
that people have sent in.
If you want to do something,
and don&#8217;t see a good way to do it,
<a href="https://github.com/ericam/susy/issues">please tell us</a></p>

<h2 id="fixabugortypo">Fix a bug or typo?</h2>

<p>Thanks!
Submit a pull request against the <code>master</code> branch,
and we&#8217;ll take a look.
If you think it might affect the tests,
or change functionality in some way,
see below.</p>

<h2 id="codeanewfeature">Code a new feature?</h2>

<p>We love getting pull requests from the community.
If you have some code, please send us a pull request.
It&#8217;s likely that we&#8217;ll ask for a few adjustments,
but don&#8217;t take it personally â€”
we often do that to each other as well.</p>

<p>We use <a href="http://compass-style.org">Compass</a>
and <a href="http://ericsuzanne.com/true">True</a> in development,
managed through <a href="http://bundler.io/">bundler</a>,
to test Susy and make sure everything is working properly.</p>

<p>We wont merge a pull request that breaks the test,
or adds a feature that is untested,
but you are welcome to submit a work in progress,
and we&#8217;ll help you sort out the details.
We&#8217;ll also ask you to update the docs.</p>

<p>When submitting a pull request, consider:
- Make sure the tests are up to date and passing
- Update the docs
- Add your changes to the
 <a href="https://github.com/ericam/susy/blob/master/docs/changelog.rst">changelog</a>.</p>

<h2 id="documentation">Documentation</h2>

<p>The docs are written as reStructuredText
(<a href="http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html">rst</a>),
and built with <a href="http://sphinx-doc.org/">sphinx</a>.</p>

<p>To build them locally:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">cd docs
pip install -r requirements.txt
make html
</code></pre>

<p>The docs are built into the <code>_build</code> directory,
as a static site you can open in your browser.</p>

<h2 id="runningtests:">Running tests:</h2>

<pre><code class="bash"># command line
gem install bundler
rake test
</code></pre>

<p>You can also run <code>compass watch</code> from the test directory
if you want the tests running in the background while you work.</p>
